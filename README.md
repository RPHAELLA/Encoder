# Encoder

> A source code encoding conversion tool

This project allows the conversion of source code from any encoding to UTF-8.

## Usage

To run the script, download and execute the `.exe` file. 

Alternatively, download the project and build the the console script locally. 

#### Run .\Encoder.exe

The script will prompt for two inputs, namely the **project directory** and the **specific extension of files** to lookout for.

While working with FlawFinder, I was hit with the following error:

> *UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte ... in position ...: invalid continuation byte*

To perform mass source code encoding conversion to UTF-8 for a client's project, the script was just a quick spin up with reference to an answer on StackOverflow written by [Timwi](https://stackoverflow.com/users/33225/timwi) and [Ivan Perevezentsev](https://stackoverflow.com/users/4027465/ivan-perevezentsev).
